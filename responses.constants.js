  CABINET: {

    content: `
      Three core members of Lincoln's cabinets, famously covered in Team of Rivals,
      by Doris Kearns Goodwin, were William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase and Edward Bates.
      Seward served as Secretary of State and became one of Lincoln's closest friends.
      Chase, who later became a Supreme Court Justice, was secretary of the Treasury. Bates was
      the US Attorney General and the first member appointed to Lincoln's cabinet in 1860.
      Seward, Bates and Chase all sought the Republican Nomination for President in 1860 and were 
      at times critical of Lincoln, making it remarkable that all three became members of 
      his cabinet.
